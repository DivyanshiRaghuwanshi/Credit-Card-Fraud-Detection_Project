# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection_Project

This project applies machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions using a real-world credit card dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of multiple models like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for comparison. The goal is to improve fraud detection accuracy while handling imbalanced class distribution.

# Key Features:

Real dataset with anonymized features

Data balancing using under-sampling

Model comparison (Decision Tree and Logistic Regression)

Evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score
